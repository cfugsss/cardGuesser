# cardGuesser

This is a program that tests if, while trying to pick a specific card, is it better to pick a card in the same position of a deck or a random position. You
can set the fuction to do as many tries as youd like but ive found that the results are very close to eachother; However, the static position usualy 
always comes out slightly above.
